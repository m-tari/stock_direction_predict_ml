### stock_drirection_predict_ml
# Motivation
The motivation of this project is to replicate results from the [repository of Buffalo Capital Management](https://github.com/wzchen/stock_market_prediction) and see if markets are still predictable in 2021. The original Kaggle competition is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-data-festival-hackathon).
 - Given the opening, closing, min, max, and volume of a stock in the previous 9 days (and given the opening price of a stock on day 10) can we predict the directional movement of a stock on day 10?

# Files
- **process.ipynb** Notebook describing my work
- **data.csv** csv file containing opening, closing, min, max, and volume of 94 stock in 500 days. The first opening date price is scaled to 1.
