### stock_drirection_predict_ml
# Motivation
The motivation of this project is to replicate results from the [repository of Buffalo Capital Management](https://github.com/wzchen/stock_market_prediction) and see if markets are still predictable in 2021.
 - Given the opening, closing, min, max, and volume of a stock in the previous 9 days (and given the opening price of a stock on day 10) can we predict the directional movement of a stock on day 10?
